# This file contains various data regarding units and structures. Every section describes one unit/structure and should look like this:
#
#
# [structure name]
# HitPoints = 500			# what is the maximum health of this structure?
# Price = 300				# how much does this structure cost?
# Power = 10				# how much power do this structure require. Wind traps have negative values because they produce power?
# ViewRange = 3				# how much terrain is revealed when this structure is placed?
# Capacity = 1000			# how much spice can this structure contain?
# BuildTime = 80			# how much time does the production of this structure take?
# InfSpawnProp = 45			# what is the probability (in percent) that a infantry soldier is spawn on destruction?
#
# [unit name]
# HitPoints = 100			# what is the maximum health of this unit?
# Price = 100				# how much does this unit cost?
# ViewRange = 5				# how much terrain is revealed when this unit is moved?
# WeaponDamage = 10			# how much damage does the weapon of this unit have?
# WeaponRange = 4			# how far can this unit shoot?
# WeaponReloadTime = 100	# how many frames does it take to reload the weapon?
# MaxSpeed = 3.0			# how fast can this unit move?
# TurnSpeed = 1.0			# how fast can this unit turn around?
# BuildTime = 56			# how much time does the production of this unit take?
# InfSpawnProp = 45			# what is the probability (in percent) that a infantry soldier is spawn on destruction?
#
# It depends on the unit/structure if a value is ignored. e.g an unarmed unit will ignore the value of weaponrange.
# The there are 2 sections for default values for structures and units. These are used if something is not specified.
